# UMAP
UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique that assumes the available data samples are evenly distributed across a topological space, which can be approximated from these finite data samples and mapped to a lower-dimensional space. I compared UMAP with t-SNE and summarized the features of UMAP.   https://youtu.be/eBH2pm-ULOM
